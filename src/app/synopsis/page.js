          Mae Miller is at a crossroads. Talented, ambitious, and restless, she
          dreams of leaving Northridge for a full scholarship in New York—but
          first, she faces the messy realities of the life she’s built. Living
          with Jess Barbosa, a kind and earnest music enthusiast who’s quietly
          holding their world together, Mae struggles with the tension between
          love and her own ambitions. In a quirky attempt to free herself, she
          sets out to find Jess a new girlfriend, thinking it’s her ticket to
          escape. But even as she orchestrates these humorous and awkward
          encounters, her feelings for Jess remain undeniable. <br />
          <br /> Between the chaos of diner kitchens, bustling farmer’s markets,
          and jazzy clarinet tunes that follow her everywhere, Mae’s journey is
          full of music, laughter, and heart. Along the way, she confronts her
          fears about leaving, her attachments to the people and rhythms of her
          hometown, and the deeper truth about what she truly wants. Jess,
          patient and loving, becomes both a mirror and a challenge to Mae,
          forcing her to question whether running away is really freedom—or just
          avoidance. <br />
          <br /> As Mae navigates love, ambition, and the hilarious fallout of
          her matchmaking scheme, she must make a choice that could change
          everything. Will she follow her dreams, or will her heart keep her
          grounded? “North by Northridge” is a vibrant, musical tale of love,
          self-discovery, and the fine line between chasing dreams and holding
          on to what matters most.
